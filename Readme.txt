Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for predicting flight fares based on various features. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the fare of a flight based on input parameters such as source, destination, date of travel, and other relevant factors.


Flight fare prediction is a common problem in the travel industry, and accurate predictions can be valuable for both customers and service providers. This project aims to build a robust machine learning model that can predict flight fares with high accuracy. The model takes into account various features such as the source and destination cities, the airline, departure time, and other relevant factors.

The dataset used for training and testing the model is included in the data directory. It contains information about various flights, including the features used for prediction and the corresponding fares.
